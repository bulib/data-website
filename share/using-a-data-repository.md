## Data Archiving at Boston University & Beyond

Boston University [IS&T's Department](http://www.bu.edu/datamanagement/resources/ist-services/) offers data security and archiving resources for the BU Community. The data archiving service is designed for secure, long-term storage of large quantities of infrequently accessed data. Examples of stored data include: experimental or sensor data, computational output, images and the results of image analysis, video files, and unstructured content.

Beyond Boston University, there are a number of data repositories available for scholars in different disciplines. Many of these data repositories feature existing data for researchers, and also host data produced by scholars from various institutions. This page provides tips for selecting a data repository for your research.

## Selecting a Repository for Your Data

As you consider where to store your data, it may be helpful to consider the following following factors:

* Format: Is the data repository a good match for the type of data you have generated? 

* Ease of use: Is the existing data that is hosted in the repository easy for the user to find and download? 

* Reputation: Is the repository reputable within your discipline or field of study? Check to see if it is endorsed by a funding agency, scholarly journal, or professional society or listed among the Registry of Research Data Repositories.

* Legal Considerations: Is there information about the terms of use for the data in the repository? Are your rights as a data depositor clearly stated?

* Visibility: Does the repository provide a unique and consistent identifier for your data? Does it provide a DOI or a citation for your data?

* Sustainability: Is the repository funded to be available for long-term use? 

There are other factors to consider when choosing a repository. These sites have more extensive suggestions for issues to consider:
