## Archiving Data

Boston University [IS&T's Department](http://www.bu.edu/datamanagement/resources/ist-services/) offers a data archiving service that provides secure, long-term storage of large quantities of infrequently accessed data for the BU community. <<is this necessary?>>

Examples of stored data include: experimental or sensor data, computational output, images and the results of image analysis, video files, and unstructured content. <<is this necessary?>>

Beyond BU, there are a number of data repositories <<suggestion: possibly define a data repository>> available for scholars in different disciplines.

Many of these repositories feature existing data for researchers, and also host data produced by scholars from various institutions <<Suggestion: Some federal governments and agencies have repositories of raw data that they share with the public. Other repositories contain data produced by researchers OR Many of these repositories feature existing data from federal government, agencies and various institutions.>>.

## Things to consider

Here are some tips on selecting a data repository for your research:

* Format: Is the data repository a good match for the type of data you have generated? <<suggestion: the question doesn't really help better understand format in this context/do you mean readability?>>

* User-friendly: Is the existing data easy for the user to find and download? 

* Reputation: Is the repository a reputable source? Check to see if it is endorsed by a funding agency, scholarly journal, professional society or listed among the Registry of Research Data Repositories.

* Legal Considerations: Is there information about the terms of use for the data in the repository? Are your rights as a data depositor clearly stated? <<suggestion: condense into one question. Possibly: 'Are your rights clearly defined in the terms of use?'' OR just 'Is there information about the terms of use for the data in the repository?' >>

* Visibility: Does the repository provide a unique and consistent identifier, such as a DOI or a citation, for your data? 

* Sustainability: Is the repository funded for long-term use?
