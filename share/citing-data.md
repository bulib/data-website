## What You'll Need 

You are familiar with citing books, films, articles and even images â€“ but what about a a collection of data from the United States Census or field notes from an anthropological study? Fortunately, the same principles apply.

When citing data, here's the information you'll need (when available):

* Creator(s) of the data
* Title of the dataset
* Year the dataset was published or submitted to a repository
* Version or edition of the dataset
* URL or DOI used to access the data
* Date you accessed the data
 
## How to Cite 

Let's cite some data! The examples below show you how to cite two datasets: [characteristics of business owners collected in the Survey of Business Owners](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SBO_2012_00CSCBO08&prodType=table), and [a dataset of behavioral measurements of hunting bats collected by Gomes, et al.](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5gk8j)
### APA 

The American Psychological Association (APA) style is commonly used to cite sources in the social sciences. Materials in this section are based on [APA Style, 6th Edition](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) from Purdue's Online Writing Lab.


Basic structure: <br>
**Creator/Rightsholder of Data (Year of publication). <i>Title of dataset</i>. [Format of dataset]. URL or DOI**

Example 1:

> United States Census Bureau (2016). <i>Statistics for owners of respondent firms by owner's age by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for the U.S.: 2012</i>. [Data file]. Retrieved from ht<i></i>tp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SBO_2012_00CSCBO08&prodType=table

Example 2:

> Gomes, D. G. E., Page, R. A., Geipel, I., Taylor, R. C., Ryan, M. J., & Halfwerk, W. (2016). <i>Bats perceptually weight prey cues across sensory systems when hunting in noise</i>. [Data file].	doi:10.5061/dryad.5gk8j


### Chicago - Bibliography 

The [Chicago Style, 16th Edition: Bibliography Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html) is a common citation style used in literature, history, and the arts. The style provides bibliographic information in the notes and usually a bibliography.

Basic structure:<br>
**Creator/Rightsholder of Data. <i>Title of dataset</i>. Version/Edition of data. Distributed by Organization or Repository, Year of publication. URL or DOI**

Example 1:

> United States Census Bureau. <i>Statistics for owners of respondent firms by owner's age by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for the U.S.: 2012</i>. American FactFinder version. Distributed by The United States Census Bureau, 2016. ht<i></i>tp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SBO_2012_00CSCBO08&prodType=table

Example 2:

> Gomes, Dylan G. E., Rachel A. Page, Inga Geipel, Ryan C. Taylor, Mike C. Ryan, and Wouter Halfwerk. <i>Bats perceptually weight prey cues across sensory systems when hunting in noise</i>. Distributed by The Dryad Digital Repository, 2016. doi:10.5061/dryad.5gk8j

### Chicago - Author-Date

The [Chicago Style, 16th Edition: Author-Date Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html) differs from the bibliography style by briefing sources in the text, usually in parenthesis, by author's last name and data of publication. The citations are then fleshed out in a list of references, where the complete bibliographic information is provided. This format is often used in the physical, natural and social sciences.**

Basic structure:<br>
**Creator/Rightsholder of Data. Year of publication. <i>Title of dataset</i>. Version/Edition of data. Distributed by Organization or Repository. URL or DOI**

Example 1:

> United States Census Bureau. 2012. <i>Statistics for owners of respondent firms by owner's age by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for the U.S.: 2012</i>. American FactFinder version. Distributed by the United States Census Bureau. 2016. ht<i></i>tp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SBO_2012_00CSCBO08&prodType=table

Example 2:

> Gomes, Dylan G. E., Rachel A. Page, Inga Geipel, Ryan C. Taylor, Mike C. Ryan, and Wouter Halfwerk. 2016. <i>Bats perceptually weight prey cues across sensory systems when hunting in noise</i>. Distributed by The Dryad Digital Repository. doi:10.5061/dryad.5gk8j

### MLA 

The Modern Language Association [MLA Style (7th Edition)](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/) is the most widely used style when it comes to writing papers and citing sources within the liberal arts and humanities community.


Basic structure:<br>
**Creator/Rightsholder of Data. <i>Title of dataset</i>. Version/Edition of data. Hosting Organization or Repository, Year of Publication. Format of Source. Date of Access. URL or DOI**

Example 1:

> United States Census Bureau. <i>Statistics for owners of respondent firms by owner's age by gender, ethnicity, race, and veteran status for the U.S.: 2012</i>. American FactFinder version. United States Census Bureau, 2016. Web. 21 September 2016. ht<i></i>tp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SBO_2012_00CSCBO08&prodType=table

Example 2:

> Gomes, Dylan G. E., Rachel A. Page, Inga Geipel, Ryan C. Taylor, Mike C. Ryan, and Wouter Halfwerk. <i>Bats perceptually weight prey cues across sensory systems when hunting in noise</i>. Dryad Digital Repository, 2016. Web. 21 September 2016. doi:10.5061/dryad.5gk8j
