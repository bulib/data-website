## What You'll Need 

You are familiar with citing books, films, articles and even images â€“ but what about a a collection of data from the United States Census or field notes from an anthropological study? Often, the same principles apply.

When citing data, here's the information you'll need (when available):

* Creator(s) of the data
* Title of the dataset
* Year the dataset was published or submitted to a repository
* Version or edition of the dataset
* URL or DOI used to access the data
* Date you accessed the data
 
## How to Cite 

Let's cite some data! The examples below show you how to cite two datasets: characteristics of business owners collected in the Survey of Business Owners, and a dataset of behavioral measurements of hunting bats collected by Gomes, et al. <<suggestion: add hyperlinks to the datasets mentioned>>

### APA 

The American Psychological Association stype is commonly used to cite sources in the social cciences. Materials in this section are based on [APA Style, 6th Edition](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) and from Purdue's Online Writing Lab.


Basic structure: <br>
**Creator/Rightsholder of Data (Year of publication). <i>Title of dataset</i>. [Format of dataset]. URL or DOI**

Example 1:

Example 2:
