## Basic Principles

You be familiar with citing books, films, articles, and even images.  But what about a collection of data, like a table in the United States Census or field notes from an anthropological study?  Often, the same principles apply.  You will need to cite the following information (when available):
* Creator(s) of the data
* Title of the dataset
* The date the dataset was published
* The date you accessed the data
* The version or edition of the data
