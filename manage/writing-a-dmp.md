## What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)? 

A data management plan (DMP) will help you think about how to manage your data for a research project, an entire lab, a department, an individual, or an entire organization. DMPs can be as long or short as needed. However, for your DMP to be effective it should cover a few key topics that will require you manage your data for the life of your project and beyond.

## Why manage your data?

Managing your data allows you to:

+ Comply with federal funding 
+ Document your work and workflows
+ Facilitate the reuse and sharing of your data 
+ Ensure your data is backed up

Data management will help prevent future headaches, like mistakenly deleting valuable research results, misplacing files, or having to redo the analysis of your data. When done properly, data management will keep your work organized and intelligible to others as well as your future self. This will make your work reproducible and give your data value after you have completed your project. 

## Components of a DMP

There are several parts to a data management plan. If you're writing a data management plan for a specific funder, like the National Science Foundation, these common components will likely apply. However, if you are applying for a grant it is always best to check your application materials for more detailed information or [ask for assistance](mailto:data@bu.edu). 

### Types of Data 

The type of data researchers collect is as varied as the researchers themselves. Examples include experimental measurements, survey results, images, text, or numerical data. When working with data, think about the following two questions<:>

+ What types of data will you be creating or capturing? 
+ How will you capture, create, and/or process the data?

Documenting the types of data you will be working with and how you will capture, create, or process that data will help you think through your methodology and how each step alters or enhances your data. 

### Contextual Details 

Contextual details, or metadata, is the information that will help others understand your data. While you may be familiar with your data, others may not know about your equipment settings, variable names, or file organization. It is important to think about the file types you're using to share your data. Some formats, like .csv or .txt, are open and can be understood by many programs. Others like, .pdf or .docx, are proprietary and may not be understood by some programs or people. 

You should also explain your data set in terms of the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Documenting all of those aspects of your data set will help others use your data effectively and within the right context. 

+ What are the file formats you plan to use (and if they are open or proprietary)?
+ What are the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your data set? 
+ What naming conventions will you use for files and variables? 

### Storage, Backup, and Security 

When managing data, it is crucial to think about storage, backup and security. These are key components to your data management plan and, because they can require using institutional resources, they are best planned for ahead of time. If you're working with sensitive data or data that involves human research subjects, a data security plan is critical.

Planning who will have access to what is an import<ant> step in managing your data. Pla<n>ning and implementing a file permissions structure for your research team will not only save time but also prevent inappropriate access to sensitive data and the mishandling of personally identifiable information. Additionally, should your personal laptop or desktop become damaged, ensuring you have a backup plan for your data could save your research project.

+ Where will your data be stored? 
+ What is your backup plan for the data?
+ How will you manage data security?
+ Who will have access to which files? 

### Provisions for Protection and Privacy

If you're working with sensitive data or data with copyright restrictions, you'll want to have a clear plan that addresses any potential privacy or ethical issues. Often, your methodology will address the anonymization of your human research subject data or your grant application might state any intellectual property concerns; however, you'll want to ensure those materials are added to your data management plan. 

Also, make sure the systems you're using to store your data are approved for those data types. For example, not all systems can safely work with HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) data. Key questions are: 

+ How are you addressing any ethical or privacy issues with human research subjects? 
+ Who will own any copyright or intellectual property rights to the data?
+ Is my storage solution appropriate for the type of data I am using? 

### Policies for Access and Reuse 

If you are planning to share your data it is important to document the policies for reuse. For instance, if you intend to make your data available when your grant ends anticipate how you will make that possible. Providing sustained access to your research data involves more than posting it on your personal website. You will likely want to [find a data repository]({{site.baseurl}}/share/selecting-a-data-repository), hosted by a trusted organization, to store your data for long-term access. 

+ What restrictions need to be placed on re-using your data?
+ What is the process for gaining access to your data?

### Plan for Archiving and Preservation 

Many funding agencies require that you make your data publicly available for the long term. Figuring out how you're going to comply with those requirements means you're going to have to think about where you're storing your data and if you're going to partner with institutional resources or a third-party. Long-term access to your data not only requires having good metadata, which clearly describes your data to others, but also means having a plan that accounts for the next 5 or more years. 

+ What is your long-term plan for preservation and maintenance of the data? 
+ If you're using a data repository, who is sponsoring it and what are the terms?
+ Who will be responsible for making sure your data is accessible in 5+ years?
