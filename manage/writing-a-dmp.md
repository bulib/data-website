This guide provides an overview to help you get started writing a data management plan. 

## What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)? 


## Why manage your data?

There are several good reasons to manage your data, such as: 

+ Complying with federal funding 
+ Documenting your work and workflows
+ Facilitating  the reuse and sharing of your data 
+ Ensuring your data is backed up

Data management is a proactive processes that will help prevent future headaches and, when done properly, will keep your work organized and intelligible to others as well as your future self. 

## Common Components of a DMP

There are several common parts to a data management plan. If you're writing a data management plan for a specific funder, these common components will likely apply. However, it is always best to check your funders documentation.  

### Types of Data 

The type of data researchers collect is as varied as the researchers themselves. Examples could be experimental measurements, survey results, images, text, or statistics. To help you think about the types of data you are working with think about the following two questions. 

+ What types of data will you be creating or capturing? 
+ How will you capture, create, and/or process the data?

Documenting the types of data you anticipate working with as well as how you will capture, create, or process that data will help you think through your methodology with a "data lens."

### Contextual Details 

Contextual details, or metadata, is the information others will need to understand your data. It is likely that you're very familiar with your data, however, the next person may not know about your equipment settings, variable names, or organization. It is important to think about the file types you're using to share your data. Some formats, like .csv or .txt, are open and can be understood by many programs. Others like, .pdf or .docx, are proprietary and may not be understood by some programs or people. 

You should also explain your data set in terms of the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Documenting all of those aspects of your data set will help others use your data effectively and within the right context. Think about: 

+ What file formats are using and are they accessible 
+ What are the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your data set? 
+ What naming conventions will you use for files and variables? 

### Storage, Backup, and Security 

When a lot of researchers think about data management their first questions are often about storage, backup, and security. This are key components to your data management plan and, because they can require procuring institutional resources, are best planned for appropriately. If you're working with sensitive data or data that involves human research subject, having a solid security plan for your work will be critical. Planning who on your research team will have permission to which files and how they will access them will not only save time, it could save you headaches if your data is shared inappropriately. Some good questions are: 

+ Where and on what media will you store the data?
+ What is your backup plan for the data?
+ How will you manage data security?

### Provisions for Protection and Privacy

If your working with sensitive data or data with copyright restrictions, you'll want to have a clear plan that addresses any potential privacy or ethical issues. Often, your methodology may address the anonymization of your human research subject data or your grant application might state any intellectual property concerns, however, you'll want to ensure those materials are incorporated into your data management plan. Be sure to clearly detail the steps you're taking to ensure the appropriate ethical or privacy concerns are addressed. Additionally, make sure the systems you're using to store your data are approved for those data types. For example, not all systems can safely work with HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) data. Key questions are: 

+ How are you addressing any ethical or privacy issues (IRB, anonymization of data)?
+ Who will own any copyright or intellectual property rights to the data?
+ Is my storage solution appropriate for the type of data I am using? 

### Policies for Access and Reuse 

If you are planning to share your data it is important to document the policies for reuse. Will your data be available after the completion of your grant? When you publish an article? Also, who will you allow to reuse your data? Will the data be restricted to members of your research team or department? Or would you like to make your data widely available to the public? If you're making your data publicly available, how will others be able to access it? Other important questions are: 

+ What restrictions need to be placed on re-use of your data?
+ What is the process for gaining access to your data?

### Plan for Archiving and Preservation 

Many funding agencies require that you make your data publicly available for the long-term. Figuring out how you're going to do comply with those requirements requires thinking about where you're going to store your data and if you're going to partner with institutional resources or a third-party. If you post your data on your website, how long will it be available and how are you going to ensure its preservation? Long-term access to your data not only requires having good metadata but it also means having a plan that accounts for the next 5, 10, or 15 years. 

+ What is your long-term plan for preservation and maintenance of the data?
