## About the DMPTool 

The DMPTool is a guide to creating comprehensive data management plans (DMPs) that meet the requirements of dozens of funding agencies. The DMPTool can also serve as a place to save your DMP and work on it with collaborators.

The DMPTool has over 50 partner institutions, including Boston University, and is a service of the University of California Digital Library. For more information about the DMPTool, check out the following video.

## Features

The DMPTool is in continuous development but the most notable features are: 

### Step-by-Step Process

The DMPTool provides step-by-step directions to selecting and writing a data management plan. This is especially useful because the DMPTool has many funder templates and requirements already on file. This allows you to simply select the funder template, type, save, and work through the process. By the end you'll have your data management plan entirely prepared!

### Templates 

The usefulness of the DMPTool is in the [numerous data management plan templates](https://dmptool.org/guidance?method=get&scope1=all) like: 

+ [National Institute of Health](https://dmptool.org/requirements_templates/21/basic.docx)
+ [National Science Foundation](https://dmptool.org/requirements_templates/2/basic.docx)
+ [Department of Energy](https://dmptool.org/requirements_templates/193/basic.docx)

### Published DMPs

Many researchers writing their first data management plan often like to look at a completed DMP before drafting one themselves. Fortunately, [the DMPTool has a library of publicly](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps?public%3Aall_scope=all), published data management plans from diverse fields of study. While we don't guarantee their quality, this is a great place to start.
