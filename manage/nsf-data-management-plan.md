## Introduction 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has been requiring data management plans since 2011. At first the inclusion of data management plans seemed more like another box to check in the grant application process, however, data management plans are becoming increasingly important.

## Templates and Examples 

If you'd like to look at a template or example, check out the DMPTool's [list of templates](https://dmptool.org/guidance?e=z&method=get&s=a&scope1=all) and [public examples](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps?public%3Aall_scope=all). 

## Requirements 

You have 2 pages - and only 2 pages - to write your data management plan. Let's review the sections your data management plan might require to adhere to NSF's policy. 

### Types 

It is normally easiest to start your data management plan with the types of data you'll be collecting. Reviewing your data types first will help ensure everyone is on the same page. It is okay to be detailed and specific when discussing your data types. If you know you're using a piece of equipement or data collection methodology be sure to mention that. The policy states: 

> the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project.

The types of data researchers work with are as diverse as the researchers themselves and their research interests. Common data types include images, numerical data, experimental data, observational data, text, or other samples. A sample from [Kimberly Anderson's DMP on "REU Site: A Multidisciplinary Research Experience in Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devies"](https://dmptool.org/plans/11390.pdf) starts:

```
The data generated from this project will be of two types. Each REU student will generate experimental data specific to his/her research project related to Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices. In addition, both quantitative and qualitative data will be generated that assesses the outcomes of the REU program. 
```

### Data and Metadata Standards 


> the standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies).

Per posse partem scaevola no, an mea enim elit pertinax, cu option aliquip quaestio sed. Audire praesent pertinacia eos ei, mea commodo gubergren eu, ut sed aperiam albucius. Quo ei rebum utamur nostrud, quo eu elitr inermis. Adipisci adolescens cu mei, pro cu erant indoctum, ut debet concludaturque pri. Ius nihil zril possit eu, id eam homero probatus.

### Access and Sharing

> policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements

### Reuse and Redistribution  

> policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives

### Archiving and Preserving 

> plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them
