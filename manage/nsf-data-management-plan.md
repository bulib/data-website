## Introduction 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) required data management plans since 2011. At first the inclusion of data management plans seemed more like another box to check in the grant application process, however, data management plans are becoming increasingly important part of NSF grant applications (and are more throughly reviewed).

## Templates and Examples 

If you'd like to look at a template or example, check out the DMPTool's [list of templates](https://dmptool.org/guidance?e=z&method=get&s=a&scope1=all) and [public examples](https://dmptool.org/public_dmps?public%3Aall_scope=all). 

## Requirements 

You have 2 pages - and only 2 pages - to write your data management plan. Let's review the sections your data management plan might require to adhere to NSF's policy. 

### Types 

It is normally easiest to start your data management plan with the types of data you'll be collecting. Reviewing your data types first will help ensure everyone is on the same page. It is okay to be detailed and specific when discussing your data types. If you know you're using a piece of equipement or data collection methodology be sure to mention that. The policy states you should include: 

> the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project.

The types of data researchers work with are as diverse as the researchers themselves and their research interests. Common data types include images, numerical data, experimental data, observational data, text, or other samples. A sample from [Kimberly Anderson's DMP on "REU Site: A Multidisciplinary Research Experience in Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devies"](https://dmptool.org/plans/11390.pdf) starts:

```
The data generated from this project will be of two types. Each REU student will generate experimental data specific to his/her research project related to Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices. In addition, both quantitative and qualitative data will be generated that assesses the outcomes of the REU program. 
```

### Data and Metadata Standards 

After you've thought through the data types you'll be generating the next step is to think about the data and metadata standards you'll be following. This section allows you to detail the specific file formats you'll be using and why you're using them. You'll also want to talk about the metadata your data will need.

What's metadata? Metadata is the information about your data that someone will need to make your data useful. This can include, but is not limited to, names to the authors, publication date, and a persistent identifier - like a DOI (digital object indentifier) or URL (universal resource locator). Other likely metadata includes documenting your naming convention, variables, date of collection or creation, and data analysis documentation. The policy states: 

> the standards to be used for data and metadata format and content (where existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented along with any proposed solutions or remedies).

It is worth noting that if there are no standards for a research field that this should be documented as well as a potential solution. While metadata can be complex, much of it can be automated if it is planned before the data is gathered. The best quote we've found about metadata comes from [cea+](https://www.flickr.com/people/centralasian/?rb=1) 

```Metadata is a love note to the future. ```[[1]](https://www.flickr.com/photos/33255628@N00/8071729256/)

And for multi-year projects, it is important to remember that note to the future is likely to be your future self. While creating metadata does take time the efforts are normally rewarded with not only clear project documentation but also increasing the reproducibility of your research. 

### Access and Sharing

One of the goals of a data management plan is to increase researchers' ability to share thier data and access other's data. Ideally, this will help varify research results and help researchers build on the work of others. However, the NSF understands that not all data can be made available. Examples of data that is best kept private includes data about human research subjects, data that might be patented, and data involving nationally senstive projects. With that said, much of the research that NSF sponsors has data that can be shared with other researchers and the public. From the policy you should include: 

> policies for access and sharing including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, or other rights or requirements

This section of your data management plan details the policies and groundrules you'll have for sharing your data. Will your data be put in a data repository? Will their be an initial embargo on access to your data? If your data won't be publically available, are there ways you can make it available to others? And if so, how will that be done? 

As you think through the access and sharing part of your data management plan, you'll likely also be thinking about how others can reuse and redistribute your data. 

### Reuse and Redistribution

Your NSF data management plan should include: 

> policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives. 

In this part of your plan you'll want to document how others will be able access your data and if there will be restrictions on what they can do with your data. You might want allow anyone to have access and distribution rights but you might also need to control how the data is shared and reused. If you do need to place restrictions on your data this is the place to discribe why and how others can comply with those restrictions.

The NSF is understanding that not all data can be made open and freely available. If you do need to place limits on the use of your data you'll need to clearly document and justify them. 

### Archiving and Preserving 

The last part of the data management plan is to describe the long-term plan for your data. For researchers used to thinking about their data within the life of a particular grant this can be a tricky thing to do. It can be additionally difficult since you're unlikely to have additional funds for your data 5 years after your grant ends. The policy asks that you discribe the 

> plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them.

The best solution to archive and preserve your data is to partner with an exsiting service or institution. There are many data repositories and [selecting the right one]({{site.baseurl}}/share/selecting-a-data-repository) is important. Many fields have data repositories that are well known to researchers in that discipline, however, not everyone is so lucky.
