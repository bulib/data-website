### Roles and responsibilities

Explain how the responsibilities regarding the management of your data will be delegated. This should include time allocations, project management of technical aspects, training requirements, and contributions of non-project staff - individuals should be named where possible. Remember that those responsible for long-term decisions about your data will likely be the custodians of the repository/archive you choose to store your data. While the costs associated with your research (and the results of your research) must be specified in the Budget Justification portion of the proposal, you may want to reiterate who will be responsible for funding the management of your data. 

#### Consider the following:

- Outline the staff/organizational roles and responsibilities for implementing this data management plan.
- Who will be responsible for data management and for monitoring the data management plan?
- How will adherence to this data management plan be checked or demonstrated?
- What process is in place for transferring responsibility for the data?
- Who will have responsibility over time for decisions about the data once the original personnel are no longer available? 

### Expected data (SBE)

Give a short description of what data will mean the context of your research project. Explain what types of data you plan to generate, including size, file formats, and number of files. Briefly describe your methods for collecting data. Consider the following:

 - What data will be generated in the course of your research?
 - What data types will you be creating or capturing?
 - How will you capture or create the data?
 - If you will be using existing data, how will you acquire it?
 - What is the relationship between the data you are collecting and the existing data?
 - What data will be preserved and shared?

### Data retention

Describe how long you plan to retain the data produced or used in your research. If you plan to embargo the data for a period of time after the research is completed, describe why this is necessary. Consider the following:

- How long will the original data collector/creator/principal investigator retain the right to use the data before opening it up to wider use?
- Explain details of any embargo periods for political/commercial/patent or publisher reasons.

###  Data format and dissemination

Describe the format of your data. Ideally, data formats will be chosen that are openly and freely available, and/or non-proprietary in nature. Consider the following:

- Which file formats will you use for your data, and why?
- What transformations (to more shareable formats) will be necessary to prepare data for preservation and data sharing?
- What form will the metadata take?
- How will you create or capture these details?
- Which metadata standards will you use and why have you chosen them? (e.g. accepted domain-local standards, widespread usage).
- What contextual details (metadata) are needed to make the data you capture or collect meaningful?

Describe how you will ensure dissemination of your data. Consider the following:

- How and when will you make the data available? (Include the resources needed to make the data available: equipment, systems, expertise, etc.)
- What other types of information should be shared regarding the data, e.g. the way it was generated, analytical and procedural, information?
- What is the process for gaining access to the data?
- Will any permission restrictions need to be placed on the data?
- How will you manage data with sensitive information?
- Are there ethical and privacy issues? If so, how will these be resolved?
- What have you done to comply with your obligations in your IRB Protocol?

### Data storage and preservation

Describe your long-term strategy for storing, archiving and preserving the data you will generate or use. Consider the following:

- What is the long-term strategy for maintaining, curating and archiving the data?
- Which archive/repository/database have you identified as a place to deposit data?
- What procedures does your intended long-term data storage facility have in place for preservation and backup?
- How long will/should data be kept beyond the life of the project?
- What data will be preserved for the long-term?
- On what basis will data be selected for long-term preservation?
- What metadata/documentation will be submitted alongside the data or created on deposit/transformation in order to make the data reusable?
- What related information will be deposited?

###  Additional data management requirements

Describe here any additional program-specific data management requirements. If none exist you may leave this section blank.
