excerpt: Find out what metadata are and how to use them

## Hi Tom ##

## What are Metadata? ##
Metadata are documentation for your data set, expressed using a formal syntax.  They are used to record all information needed for your data's future use, and attached to the data set itself, usually as separate files. Here is a list of what metadata might contain:

+ a brief or detailed description of the data itself;
+ names, labels and descriptions for variables, records and their values;
+ explanation of codes and classification schemes used; 
+ codes of, and reasons for, missing values; 
+ derived data created after collection, with code, algorithm or command file used to create them; 
+ weighting and grossing variables created and how they should be used; 
+ data listing with descriptions for cases, individuals or items studied, for example for logging qualitative interviews; 
+ descriptions of applications (commercial or open-source) were used to run analyses, and the versions of those applications; 
+ descriptions of file formats used to store the data; 
+ documentation of experimental protocols; 
+ documentation of the code written for statistical and other analyses. 


## What Kind of Metadata Should I Use? ##
That depends on your field.  Here are some standards and controlled vocabularies (standard terminology for specific fields). If you don't see your field represented, let's talk -- we may be able to find a standard for you, or help in some other way.

## What Else Should I Document? ##
This really depends on your project, but here are some ideas to get you started. We will be happy to help you come up with a final list of documentation needed for your dataset.

+ context of data collection (project history, aims, objectives, hypotheses); 
+ data collection methods (data collection protocol, sampling design, instruments, hardware and software used, data scale and resolution, temporal coverage and geographic coverage); 
+ structure and organization of data files; 
+ data sources used; 
+ data validation, quality assurance procedures carried out; 
+ transformations of data from the raw data through analysis; 
+ information on confidentiality, access &amp; use conditions.
