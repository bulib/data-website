## What is a Naming Convention? 

<Define file naming conventions – is the last bullet point under “Why Use File Naming Conventions?” the definition?>

## Why Use File Naming Conventions?

+ Having file naming conventions for your research makes it easier to organize, track, and find the data you have collected.
+ It prevents confusion among other researchers who may also be creating and modifying files.
+ It makes it easier for other researchers to find and interpret your data.
+ Naming conventions help you track different versions of a file and determine which is the most current.

## Things to Do 

As you and your research partners establish file naming conventions, we recommend you consider <these guidelines>:

+ Define file conventions at the start of your project and follow them consistently during the course of your research.
+ Provide documentation about your file How so? naming conventions for those who are collaborating on the research.
+ Use descriptive file names that are meaningful to you and your colleagues. This might include the project name, subject, or acronym.
+ Keep file names relatively short.
+ Include dates in your filename, which this can help you with sorting and version control. <What is sorting and version control?> When using dates, we recommend this format: yyyymmdd.
+ Using a sequential numbering system to keep track of different versions or revisions to a file. You may find if helpful to use leading 0’s to enable file sorting in a sequential order. (for example: rehab01, rehab02, rehab03 instead of rehab1, rehab2, rehab3.)


## Things to Avoid 

+ Using spaces within your files; not all software recognizes spaces within file names.
+ Special characters in your file names such as: "/ \ : * ? " < > [ ] & $. These characters have specific meanings for various operating systems, and could result in your files being deleted or misplaced.
+ Names that are too long and may not not have meaning to you and other researchers on your team.
