excerpt: This tutorial is primarily aimed at those who have some experience programming in another language, such as MATLAB, and want to learn to read, write, and modify C codes in a Unix environment. Although previous programming experience would be helpful, it is not mandatory. In this tutorial we will cover basic syntax, and write, compile, and run some simple codes. Basics of makefiles will also be covered. Please remember to sign up for all four sessions to complete the tutorial.
