excerpt: How did digital humanities start? What have humanities and social sciences practitioners done in it so far? What are they doing these days? In what ways is it useful to modern-day researchers in these fields? What venues exist for scholarly communication in DH? We will speak specifically to fields represented in the room. We will then introduce some basic activities that make up digital scholarship, applicable to both students and faculty-level researchers in the humanities and social sciences. Participants will leave with a list of suggested resources to follow up on if they wish.
