excerpt: One of the biggest challenges in translational research is the development of methods to predict phenotype—an organism’s physical characteristics—from what we know about the genome and environment. Unpacking phenotypic complexity will require the convergence of research across biology, computer science, medicine, engineering, and others. Attend this Research on Tap to learn what BU faculty are doing to unlock the mysteries of phenotype.
