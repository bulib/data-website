excerpt: The shell, or command line, is likely the most powerful (and intimidating) tool on your computer. It is probably the most underutilized too. This workshop is designed to help you "get to know your" shell. We will be using the <a title="Software Carpentry" href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> lesson "<a title="The Unix Shell" href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">The Unix Shell</a>" to learn&colon; <br><br>+ What the shell is and why it exists<br>+ How to navigate files and directories<br>+ Using pipes and filters<br>+ How to find things<br><br><strong>**Note</strong>&colon; If you're comfortable manipulating files, using grep, and writing simple scripts, this session is unlikely to benefit you.<br><br>Installation guides and "office hours" for assistance will be provided after registration.<br><br>Join us in Mugar Library's Estin Room (room 302) at 12:30. Space is limited. Attendees will need to bring their own laptop in order to fully participate.<br><br> Date&colon; Oct. 26, 2017 <br> Location&colon; Mugar Library Estin Room (302) <br>Time&colon; 12:30-1:30<br><br> <a class="btn-lg btn-success" role="button" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=zDJ91SHBj0iwe9_nBWgMcZ065r6Cdk5BvRcFWPtpp_ZUODhEVVpKS0kxVEVXQzVDNVlKR1lSRVZQWC4u">Register</a>
