excerpt: Originally designed to render computer graphics, GPUs now provide the ability to accelerate scientific applications traditionally handled by CPUs. This tutorial is an introduction to general programming using GPUs. We will explore the applications that would benefit the most from GPU acceleration, go over different languages and software tools available on our Linux cluster, and discuss their benefits for different types of applications.
