excerpt: Perl is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used for a wide variety of programming tasks, including, but not limited to, text/data processing, system administration, and Web applications. Combing elements of C, Unix shell scripting languages, as well as text-processing utilities such as sed and awk, Perl can be used for both large scale projects and for small applications. Some experience in a command line environment (e.g. Unix) is helpful, but the basics of Perl are simpler than those of other languages making it accessible to a new programmer. Attending our Introduction to Linux tutorial or equivalent background is recommended. Please remember to sign up for all four sessions to complete the tutorial.
