excerpt: Communities are increasingly recognized as critical determinants of health and well-being. Commensurate with growing scholarship in the area, several leading health professional schools have developed academic concentrations in community health sciences. This emerging field includes a breadth of disciplines ranging from anthropology to sociology and an array of content foci ranging from social context and health behaviors to maternal and child health. Not only does this diverse field provide tremendous opportunities, but it also presents complex new challenges.
