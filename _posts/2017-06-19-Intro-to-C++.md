excerpt: This tutorial is aimed at those who want to learn to read, write, and modify C++ code. Although previous programming experience in languages such as C, MATLAB, or Python would be helpful, it is not mandatory. In this tutorial series we will cover basic syntax, object-oriented programming concepts, and basic C++ language features. This is a hands-on tutorial and we will write, compile, and run some simple codes using the Code::Blocks integrated development environment. Please remember to sign up for all four sessions to complete the tutorial.
