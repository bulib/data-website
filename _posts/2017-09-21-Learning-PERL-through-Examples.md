excerpt: This Perl tutorial, offered on the BU Medical Campus, is designed with some possible bioinformatical applications of the language in mind. It is oriented towards those who have little or no prior programming experience and would like to get a solid start. It will introduce Perl through an integrated approach, covering all of the fundamentals of the Perl language, from code design and implementation to debugging and execution. It will also include information on the Perl help system, to ease the learning curve and provide an entry point for continuous exploration of the language. The tutorial itself will focus mostly on methodology and concepts; however, it will make an effort to achieve this goal through several quite simple, yet representative, code examples. The entire tutorial will be divided into two sessions. The first session will give students a brief overview and general information about Perl, with some hands-on exercises. The second session will focus on some frequently used language features, such as file I/O, string processing, regular expressions, and even some more advanced features, such as code reuse. All of the features will be introduced through some real bioinformatical examples. Please remember to sign up for both sessions to complete the tutorial.
