excerpt: The OpenMP application program interface (API) provides simple and flexible tools to develop parallel software for shared-memory multiprocessor systems. The basic approach to parallelizing with OpenMP is to insert special comments (directives) into the code that assist the compiler in mapping computation onto the CPUs. The beauty of this approach is that it is often possible to create efficient parallel code with only minor modifications to a serial code. This tutorial covers the major features of OpenMP through discussion and examples in C and Fortran. Some experience in C or Fortran programming is assumed. Understanding of parallel programming in general is helpful, but not required.
