excerpt: This webinar will focus on how to use the Open Science Framework (OSF https://osf.io) to tie together and organize multiple projects. We will look at example structures appropriate for organizing classroom projects, a line of research, or a whole lab's activity. We will discuss the OSF's capabilities for using projects as templates, linking projects, and forking projects as well as some considerations for using each of those capabilities when designing a structure for your own project.n
