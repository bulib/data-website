excerpt: Topic models hold power for answering questions about textual corpora at scale. All the same, getting started with topic modeling can be intimidatingâ€”and working with topic models without understanding the theory behind them can easily lead to misinterpretations. In this introductory session, we will discuss what topic models can do, how they work, their potential and limitations. We will share several examples of research projects and processes using topic models and work with participants to determine how they might frame their own research questions in ways that could be answered with topic modeling. The session will give participants a solid understanding of how topic modeling works, so that they can decide whether they want to go further with learning how to use topic models in their research.
