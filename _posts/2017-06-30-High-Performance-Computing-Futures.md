excerpt: HPC Futures is a one day exploration of ideas and planning for future computational research at the Boston area universities, institutes, hospitals, libraries and companies. Future needs may be driven both by ambitious research goals, by increasing needs to work across traditional academic and institutional boundaries, by increasing interaction with national and international cyberinfrastructures and by technological advances such as IoT, cloud computing, deep learning, computer hardware advances and cybersecurity considerations. We examine these issues within a celebration of the most exciting and important research happening in the Boston area.
