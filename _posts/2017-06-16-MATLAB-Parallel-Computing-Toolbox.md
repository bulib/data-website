excerpt: The MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox allows you to write programs that leverage multi-core processors, GPUs, and computer clusters by dividing up work between independent cores. Converting serial MATLAB applications to parallel MATLAB applications usually requires few code modifications and no programming in a low-level language. This tutorial will introduce MATLAB parallel processing tools, such as parfor, spmd, and distributed array types.
