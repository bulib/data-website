excerpt: From Professor Rinner&colon; &quot;In this talk I will give an overview of privacy challenges in visual data. I will then present selected key achievements from our ten years&apos; research in privacy-aware cameras. A key approach for privacy protection is to deteriorate the image quality of selected areas or entire frames. We have developed &quote;cartooning&quot as an onboard protection method which requires low computational resources and keeps the utility of the protected video high. In another research thread we have investigated adaptive privacy filters which modify the strength of the deterioration based on the captured scenes. I will conclude the talk by demonstrating our TrustEYE, an embedded smart camera which performs onboard privacy filtering and secures all delivered data with dedicated hardware.&quot;
