excerpt: In this session, we will focus upon fundamental concepts and skills to begin using GIS software and online platforms in Digital Humanities. We will talk about GIS, and spatial data (concept, and format). We will explore different ways to collect spatial data and to convert spatial data into a GIS friendly version. A list of GIS online platforms and programs will be introduced which we can utilize in digital humanities and social science projects. We will look into some examples of GIS projects in digital humanities and explore the programs and platforms to create these projects.
