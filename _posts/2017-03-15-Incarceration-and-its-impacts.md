excerpt: In the past four decades, the United States more than quadrupled the size of its prison system. This change in penal policy had a wide range of unwanted and profound social costs. At this Research on Tap, BU faculty will discuss their work to understand the consequences of the U.S. prison system on social and economic insecurity, families, neighborhoods, health and healthcare, democratic institutions, and the quality of membership in American society.
