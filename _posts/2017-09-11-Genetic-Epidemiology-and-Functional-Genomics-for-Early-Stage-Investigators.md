excerpt: An intensive, three day meeting utilizing the unique data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). The mission of this three-day workshop is to enable young clinical investigators and clinician scientists (MDs and PhDs) with the tools and resources to use epidemiological data to perform cardiovascular translational research, using data from FHS as an example. The meeting will be a combination of discussion sessions and hands on training.  Lecture sessions will focus on key topic areas led by leaders in the field where they will discuss how they have accessed FHS data to answer career-building questions. The hands-on experience on the computer will include instruction on how to access FHS data, how to analyze the data, and how to evaluate the utility of the data for collaborations and grant applications. In addition, individual career counseling sessions will be offered by senior investigators.
