excerpt: This hour-long webinar is an introduction to using the Open Science Framework (OSF https://osf.io) - a free, open source web application built to help researchers manage their workflows. The OSF is part collaboration tool, part version control software, and part data archive. The OSF connects to popular tools researchers already use, like Dropbox, Box, Github and Mendeley, to streamline workflows and increase efficiency.
