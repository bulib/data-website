excerpt: On contemporary computers, speeding up computations is most often achieved by employing multiprocessors concurrently on shared memory, multicored nodes or multiprocessor distributed memory clusters. MPI is a library of communication functions to enable and enhance multiprocessing on these computer architectures. This tutorial introduces many of the basic MPI functions through practical examples. Working knowledge of C or Fortran is required to attend the course. Basic knowledge of Unix/Linux will be helpful.
