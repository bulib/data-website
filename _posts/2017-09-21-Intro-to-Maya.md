excerpt: Autodesk Maya 2017 is a powerful state-of-the-art 3D modeling and animation software package. It has a wide variety of modeling, animation, special effects, and rendering tools. It has a customizable graphical user interface as well as a scripting language for optimal flexibility in problem solving and production. In this tutorial we will show you how to get started using Maya. We will teach you the basic workflow for modeling, creating and applying materials, animation, and rendering. We will also cover the basics of importing scientific geometric data and creating high quality renderings and animations from it. Ordinarily Maya is considered to have a steep learning curve, but in this tutorial we will present a workflow which will provide a sound foundation for pursuing more complex projects.
