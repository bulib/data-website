excerpt: Communities are increasingly recognized as critical determinants of health and well-being. Commensurate with growing scholarship in the area, several leading health professional schools have developed academic concentrations in community health sciences. This emerging field includes a breadth of disciplines ranging from anthropology to sociology and an array of content foci ranging from social context and health behaviors to maternal and child health. Not only does this diverse field provide tremendous opportunities, but it also presents complex new challenges. The Dean's Symposium will bring together faculty from across the nation to discuss the future of community health sciences, aiming to better map the remit and scope of the field. Featuring Robert M. Kaplan, Former Chief Science Officer, US Agency for Health Care Research and Quality&#59; Research Director, Clinical Excellence Research Center, Stanford School of Medicine and Nina Wallerstein, Director, Center for Participatory Research, and Professor of Public Health, College of Population Health, University of New Mexico.
