<p>According the the Registry of Research Data Repositories (<a href="http://www.re3data.org/">re3data.org</a>) and data repository is a</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>subtype of a sustainable information infrastructure which provides long-term storage and access to research data that is the basis for a scholarly publication. Research data means information objects generated by scholarly projects for example through experiments, measurements, surveys or interviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phrased differently, a <strong>data repository provides long-term storage</strong> to the data that underpins scholarly publications. Data repositories are institutional efforts to provide sustainable, preservation to the data created by researchers. Data repositories serve to ensure research data is accessible beyond the life of a grant, research project, or individual careers. </p>

<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>

<p>There are now many data repositories in existence today. Some will be a better fit for you needs then others. Here are some tips on selecting a data repository for your research:</p>

<h3 id="reputation">Reputation</h3>

<p>Is the repository a reputable source? Check to see if it is endorsed by a funding agency, scholarly journal, professional society, library, and is listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories. Publishing your data, like publishing an article, is best done with a reputable partner that has the backing of an institutional or your research community.  </p>

<h3 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h3>

<p>Having you data deposited in a repository that is unsustainable kind of defeats the point of depositing it. This is why it is important to make sure your repository has the backing of an institution, community, or funder. You’ll want to ensure the depository you select will be providing access to your data for well over 5 years. Many repositories will also have preservation plans and contingency plans on the outside chance funding is ceased. Don’t be afraid to ask about these plans. </p>

<h3 id="visibility">Visibility</h3>

<p>One of the primary reasons to deposit your data in a repository is to obtain a unique identifier that others can use you to cite your data. This service will increase the visibility of your data within the scholarly literature and allow researchers to find it later on. Ensure your data repository offers a DOI (digital object identifier), handle, or another unique indentifer.</p>

<p>Another way to think about visibility is ask if researchers in your field use a repository. Some disciplines have an agreed upon repository that everyone uses and knows about. Ensure that you’re putting your data where the appropriate researchers are likely to find it (and hopefully use it). </p>

<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>

<p>Selecting a data repository that is usable is also important to ensuring others will be able to access your data. Unfortunately, not all repositories have the funding for creating great web interfaces with simple, intuitive interactions. However, if your peers are unable to find and download your data it will limit the effectiveness of sharing your data. A usable data repository should allow for users to easily upload, download, and cite data sets. </p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>Some data repositories have really great features like integrations with Open Science Framework, GitHub, or other commercial storage solutions. While these feature may not be the keystones to providing long-term access to your data, they can help you share your data more frequently and effectively. Additionally, having an author dashboard or easy-to-understand licensing - like Creative Commons - can make your life a little easier. Lastly, you’ll want to review the upload and storage limits. Some repositories offer limited free storage before a fee is charged. Be sure to look over each data repositories features and compare them with comparable services. </p>

<h3 id="formats">Formats</h3>

<p>Most data repositories are able to handle most formats, however, that doesn’t always guarantee that they’ll be able to work with your data. Be sure to take a look at the repositories documentation to ensure they can store the data you’ve generated. Less importantly, but still worth considering, is learn if the repository can generate previews or provide other user interactions with your data. While these features are not essential from a preservation perspective, they do help users understand and access your data. </p>

<h3 id="rights">Rights</h3>

<p>Know your rights! Take time to read the terms of use and to understand what permissions you’re giving the data repository. Additionally, does your data repository use common licensing agreements (again like Creative Commons) that will help others understand what they can and cannot do with your data?</p>

<p>Is a best practice for data repository to clearly state the terms of use and have a FAQ (frequently asked questions) section to help users understand the service being provided. If you’re unsure about your rights as a user, contact the repository to learn more. </p>

<h2 id="openbu">OpenBU</h2>

<p>OpenBU is the institutional repository for all creative and scholarly research outputs of Boston University. <a href="https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/20284">BU Research Data</a> is an archive collection in OpenBU for digital research data generated by Boston University faculty, researchers, students, alumni, and staff. OpenBU provides long-term digital preservation and open access to data. All data in the collection are curated to increase potential for access and are assigned permanent links (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System">Handles</a>).</p>

<p>Beyond BU, there are a number of data repositories to scholars but there are a few things to keep in mind when you deposit your data. </p>

<h2 id="general-solutions">General Solutions</h2>

<p>A “general” data repository is subject independent and will have data from many fields. General data repositories are often well-known solutions with large user communities. General repositories are great places to store all your data and they tend to have great features, have strong institutional backing, and are indexed by major search engines like Google and Bing. However, the downside of general repositories is that there is a lot of everything and users might not be able to find your work. </p>

<p>A few examples of general data repositories are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Dryad - <a href="http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> is a non-profit membership organization. Members like Oxford University Press and the American Association for the Advancement of Science help finance Dryad to supprot its mission to “to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.” Dryad works with over <a href="http://datadryad.org/themes/Mirage/docs/DryadAnnualReport2015.pdf">80 journals and published 3,927 data packages in 2015</a>.</li>
  <li>Figshare - <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a> is a part of the <a href="https://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a> portfolio of services. While some of Figshare’s services are free to users, it’s business model also includes working with institutions, publishers, and rresearchers to fund its data repository. <a href="https://figshare.com/about">Since 2012 Figshare</a> has 800,000 user uploads, 7.5 millon downloads, over 26 million page views. </li>
  <li>Harvard Dataverse - <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/">Harvard’s Dataverse</a> is both a <a href="http://dataverse.org/">platform for institutions</a> and a data repository. Backed and developed by Harvard’s IQSS, Libraries, and Information Technology, Dataverse has 22 installations with over 48,000 datasets, and 2 million downloads. </li>
  <li>Zenodo - Funded by <a href="http://home.cern/">CERN</a>, <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/">OpenAIRE</a>, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a> <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> accepts <a href="https://zenodo.org/faq">50GB per dataset</a> and <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">integrates nicely with GitHub</a>. While Zenodo doens’t seem to detail its download numbers like other services, it is partnered with CERN, which stores more than <a href="https://zenodo.org/faq">100PB (petabytes) of data</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="subject-specific">Subject Specific</h2>

<p>Many subject-specific data repositories exist today. Unlike a general data repository, discipline-based repositories can be very specific and well known within a particular field. This can be both a good thing and a bad thing. On the upside, if your field has a specific repository you’re data will likely be seen by the right people - increasing its chance for reuse and further influence. The downside is that researchers outside of that discipline might not know to look where to look for your data. Generally speaking if a subject-specific data repository exisits for your research it is a good idea to use. </p>

<p>Finding, listing, and keeping up with all the repositoires in exisitence is best done by a directories. A few we recommend searching are: </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.re3data.org/">Re3data.org</a>: The Registry of Resarch Data Repositories is a service provided by DataCite (a global non-profit that provides DOIs - Digial Object Identifiers). With over 1,500 data repositories listed re3data.org is likely to have a repository in your discipline. </li>
  <li><a href="http://opendoar.org/">OpenDoar</a>: OpenDOAR (Directory of Open Access Repositories) is an curated and authorative list of academic open access repositories. Not only do staff of OpenDOAR visit each repositorty listed but they also review each repository for quality (a pretty big task considering they have 2,600 listings). Included in OpenDOAR are datasets, articles, books, and software. </li>
  <li>Simmons College hosts the <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Data_repositories">Open Access Directory’s list of Data Repositories</a>. The Open Access Directory is maintained by the Open Access community and an editorial board. It includes repositories ranging from Archaeology to Physics. </li>
