	    <h2 id="what-is-a-data-management-plan-dmp">What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)?</h2>

<p>A data management plan will help you think about how to manage your data. Data management plans, often abbreviated as DMPs, can be for a research project, an entire lab, a department, an individual, or an entire organization. DMPs can be as long or short as needed. However, for your DMP to be effective it should cover a few key topics will require you to think about your project from a “data” perspective.</p>

<p>And if you have any questions, be sure to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#100;&#097;&#116;&#097;&#064;&#098;&#117;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;">email us</a>. </p>

<h2 id="why-manage-your-data">Why manage your data?</h2>

<p>There are several good reasons to manage your data, such as: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Complying with federal funding </li>
  <li>Documenting your work and workflows</li>
  <li>Facilitating the reuse and sharing of your data </li>
  <li>Ensuring your data is backed up</li>
</ul>

<p>Data management is a proactive processes that will help prevent future headaches and, when done properly, will keep your work organized and intelligible to others as well as your future self. </p>

<h2 id="common-components-of-a-dmp">Common Components of a DMP</h2>

<p>There are several common components to a data management plan. If you’re writing a data management plan for a specific funder, these common components will likely apply. However, it is always best to check your application materials for more detailed information. </p>

<h3 id="types-of-data">Types of Data</h3>

<p>The type of data researchers collect is as varied as the researchers themselves. Examples could be experimental measurements, survey results, images, text, or numerical data. To help you think about the types of data you are working with think about the following two questions. </p>

<ul>
  <li>What types of data will you be creating or capturing? </li>
  <li>How will you capture, create, and/or process the data?</li>
</ul>

<p>Documenting the types of data you will be working with and how you will capture, create, or process that data will help you think through your methodology with a “data lens.”</p>

<h3 id="contextual-details">Contextual Details</h3>

<p>Contextual details, or metadata, is the information others will need to understand your data. It is likely that you’re very familiar with your data, however, the next person may not know about your equipment settings, variable names, or file organization. It is important to think about the file types you’re using to share your data. Some formats, like .csv or .txt, are open and can be understood by many programs. Others like, .pdf or .docx, are proprietary and may not be understood by some programs or people. </p>

<p>You should also explain your data set in terms of the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Documenting all of those aspects of your data set will help others use your data effectively and within the right context. Think about: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The file formats you plan to use (and if they are open or proprietary)</li>
  <li>What are the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your data set? </li>
  <li>What naming conventions will you use for files and variables? </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="storage-backup-and-security">Storage, Backup, and Security</h3>

<p>When a lot of researchers think about data management their first questions are often about storage, backup, and security. This are key components to your data management plan and, because they can require using institutional resources, they are best planned for ahead of time. If you’re working with sensitive data or data that involves human research subjects, having a data security plan will be critical. Planning file permissions for your research team and how everyone will access the data will not only save time, it could save you large headaches if your data is shared inappropriately. Some good questions are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Where will our data be stored? </li>
  <li>What is your backup plan for the data?</li>
  <li>How will you manage data security?</li>
  <li>Who will access to which files? </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="provisions-for-protection-and-privacy">Provisions for Protection and Privacy</h3>

<p>If your working with sensitive data or data with copyright restrictions, you’ll want to have a clear plan that addresses any potential privacy or ethical issues. Often, your methodology may address the anonymization of your human research subject data or your grant application might state any intellectual property concerns, however, you’ll want to ensure those materials are added to your data management plan. Clearly detail the steps you’re taking to ensure the appropriate ethical or privacy concerns are addressed. Additionally, make sure the systems you’re using to store your data are approved for those data types. For example, not all systems can safely work with HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) data. Key questions are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>How are you addressing any ethical or privacy issues (IRB, anonymization of data)?</li>
  <li>Who will own any copyright or intellectual property rights to the data?</li>
  <li>Is my storage solution appropriate for the type of data I am using? </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="policies-for-access-and-reuse">Policies for Access and Reuse</h3>

<p>If you are planning to share your data it is important to document the policies for reuse. If you are planning on making your data available when your grant ends try to anticipate how to make that possible. Providing sustained access to your research data involves more than posting it on your personal website and you will likely want to find a data repository, hosted by a trusted organization, to store your data for long-term access. </p>

<ul>
  <li>What restrictions need to be placed on re-use of your data?</li>
  <li>What is the process for gaining access to your data?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plan-for-archiving-and-preservation">Plan for Archiving and Preservation</h3>

<p>Many funding agencies require that you make your data publicly available for the long-term. Figuring out how you’re going to do comply with those requirements requires thinking about where you’re going to store your data and if you’re going to partner with institutional resources or a third-party. Long-term access to your data not only requires having good metadata but it also means having a plan that accounts for the next 5, 10, or 15 years. </p>

<ul>
  <li>What is your long-term plan for preservation and maintenance of the data? </li>
  <li>If you’re using a data repository, who is sponsoring it and what are the terms?</li>
  <li>Who will be responsible for making sure your data is accessible in 5+ years? </li>
</ul>
