In this introductory session, we will discuss what topic models can do, how they work, their potential and limitations. We will share several examples of research projects and processes using topic models and work with participants to determine how they might frame their own research questions in ways that could be answered with topic modeling. The session will give participants a solid understanding of how topic modeling works, so that they can decide whether they want to go further with learning how to use topic models in their research.</p>

The basic approach to parallelizing with OpenMP is to insert special comments (directives) into the code that assist the compiler in mapping computation onto the CPUs. The beauty of this approach is that it is often possible to create efficient parallel code with only minor modifications to a serial code. This tutorial covers the major features of OpenMP through discussion and examples in C and Fortran. Some experience in C or Fortran programming is assumed. Understanding of parallel programming in general is helpful, but not required.</p>

It is oriented towards those who have little or no prior programming experience and would like to get a solid start. It will introduce Perl through an integrated approach, covering all of the fundamentals of the Perl language, from code design and implementation to debugging and execution. It will also include information on the Perl help system, to ease the learning curve and provide an entry point for continuous exploration of the language. The tutorial itself will focus mostly on methodology and concepts; however, it will make an effort to achieve this goal through several quite simple, yet representative, code examples. The entire tutorial will be divided into two sessions. The first session will give students a brief overview and general information about Perl, with some hands-on exercises. The second session will focus on some frequently used language features, such as file I/O, string processing, regular expressions, and even some more advanced features, such as code reuse. All of the features will be introduced through some real bioinformatical examples. Please remember to sign up for both sessions to complete the tutorial.</p>

This seeming difference is reflected in most semantic accounts of number words ("three") and measure phrases ("three pounds"). I argue that when we examine the nature of counting with mixed fractions ("two and a half") we discover that our semantic accounts of counting and measuring should be continuous. I then propose a semantics of number words that incorporates this discovery.</p>

I will then present selected key achievements from our ten years&apos; research in privacy-aware cameras. A key approach for privacy protection is to deteriorate the image quality of selected areas or entire frames. We have developed &quote;cartooning&quot as an onboard protection method which requires low computational resources and keeps the utility of the protected video high. In another research thread we have investigated adaptive privacy filters which modify the strength of the deterioration based on the captured scenes. I will conclude the talk by demonstrating our TrustEYE, an embedded smart camera which performs onboard privacy filtering and secures all delivered data with dedicated hardware.&quot;</p>

Fortunately, it does not take a professional programmer to write an efficient MATLAB program or to take advantage of multi-core processors and computer clusters. This tutorial will introduce (1) using MATLAB on the BU SCC, and (2) optimizing MATLAB codes. The first part will cover how to use the MATLAB platform remotely and how submitting batch jobs for MATLAB works. In the second part, some useful skills for removing unnecessary computation and optimizing memory usage will be introduced. The skills you learn should enable you to solve bigger problems faster using MATLAB.</p>

David Mellor (Project Manager, Center for Open Science) will discuss how researchers can combine Registered Reports with the Preregistration Challenge using the tools on the Open Science Framework to support both. Intended audience&#58; Researchers and scientists who are considering about would like to learn more about about preregistration or submitting an article as a Registered Report. By the end of the webinar, attendees will know what Registered Reports are, what problems they address, where they can be submitted, and how to use the Open Science Framework to create a preregistration.</p>

This Linux cluster has more than 6000 processors and over two petabytes of storage available for Research Computing by students and faculty on the Charles River and BUMC campuses. A very large number of software packages for programming, mathematics, data analysis, plotting, statistics, visualization, and domain-specific disciplines are available as well on the SCC. You will get a general overview of the SCC and the facility that houses it and then a hands-on introduction covering connecting to and using the SCC for new users.</p>
