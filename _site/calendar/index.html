			      <p class="workshop-excerpt">An intensive, three day meeting utilizing the unique data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). The mission of this three-day workshop is to enable young clinical investigators and clinician scientists (MDs and PhDs) with the tools and resources to use epidemiological data to perform cardiovascular translational research, using data from FHS as an example. The meeting will be a combination of discussion sessions and hands on training.  Lecture sessions will focus on key topic areas led by leaders in the field where they will discuss how they have accessed FHS data to answer career-building questions. The hands-on experience on the computer will include instruction on how to access FHS data, how to analyze the data, and how to evaluate the utility of the data for collaborations and grant applications. In addition, individual career counseling sessions will be offered by senior investigators.</p>

			      <p class="workshop-excerpt">Communities are increasingly recognized as critical determinants of health and well-being. Commensurate with growing scholarship in the area, several leading health professional schools have developed academic concentrations in community health sciences. This emerging field includes a breadth of disciplines ranging from anthropology to sociology and an array of content foci ranging from social context and health behaviors to maternal and child health. Not only does this diverse field provide tremendous opportunities, but it also presents complex new challenges. The Dean's Symposium will bring together faculty from across the nation to discuss the future of community health sciences, aiming to better map the remit and scope of the field. Featuring Robert M. Kaplan, Former Chief Science Officer, US Agency for Health Care Research and Quality&#59; Research Director, Clinical Excellence Research Center, Stanford School of Medicine and Nina Wallerstein, Director, Center for Participatory Research, and Professor of Public Health, College of Population Health, University of New Mexico.</p>

This “hands-on” tutorial will introduce the basic steps for compiling small- to medium-sized projects. Topics include working with multiple source files, header files, and external libraries, options for debugging and optimization, and automation using Make and Autotools (configure). For simplicity, we will only cover the build process for systems with a Linux operating system (such as the BU Shared Computing Cluster). Familiarity with the Linux command line is assumed. Familiarity with C or Fortran will be helpful, but is not required.</p>

Although previous programming experience in languages such as C, MATLAB, or Python would be helpful, it is not mandatory. In this tutorial series we will cover basic syntax, object-oriented programming concepts, and basic C++ language features. This is a hands-on tutorial and we will write, compile, and run some simple codes using the Code::Blocks integrated development environment.

Fortunately, it does not take a professional programmer to write an efficient MATLAB program or to take advantage of multi-core processors and computer clusters. This tutorial will introduce (1) using MATLAB on the BU SCC, and (2) optimizing MATLAB codes. The first part will cover how to use the MATLAB platform remotely and how submitting batch jobs for MATLAB works. In the second part, some useful skills for removing unnecessary computation and optimizing memory usage will be introduced. The skills you learn should enable you to solve bigger problems faster using MATLAB.</p>

It has a wide variety of modeling, animation, special effects, and rendering tools. It has a customizable graphical user interface as well as a scripting language for optimal flexibility in problem solving and production. In this tutorial we will show you how to get started using Maya. We will teach you the basic workflow for modeling, creating and applying materials, animation, and rendering. We will also cover the basics of importing scientific geometric data and creating high quality renderings and animations from it. Ordinarily Maya is considered to have a steep learning curve, but in this tutorial we will present a workflow which will provide a sound foundation for pursuing more complex projects.</p>

David Mellor (Project Manager, Center for Open Science) will discuss how researchers can combine Registered Reports with the Preregistration Challenge using the tools on the Open Science Framework to support both. Intended audience&#58; Researchers and scientists who are considering about would like to learn more about about preregistration or submitting an article as a Registered Report. By the end of the webinar, attendees will know what Registered Reports are, what problems they address, where they can be submitted, and how to use the Open Science Framework to create a preregistration.</p>

			      <p class="workshop-excerpt">This tutorial will introduce Boston University’s Shared Computing Cluster (SCC) in Holyoke, MA. This Linux cluster has more than 6000 processors and over two petabytes of storage available for Research Computing by students and faculty on the Charles River and BUMC campuses. A very large number of software packages for programming, mathematics, data analysis, plotting, statistics, visualization, and domain-specific disciplines are available as well on the SCC. You will get a general overview of the SCC and the facility that houses it and then a hands-on introduction covering connecting to and using the SCC for new users.</p>
