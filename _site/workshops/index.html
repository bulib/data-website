		  <p class="workshop-excerpt">This tutorial will introduce Boston University’s Shared Computing Cluster (SCC) in Holyoke, MA. This Linux cluster has more than 6000 processors and over two petabytes of storage available for Research Computing by students and faculty on the Charles River and BUMC campuses. A very large number of software packages for programming, mathematics, data analysis, plotting, statistics, visualization, and domain-specific disciplines are available as well on the SCC. You will get a general overview of the SCC and the facility that houses it and then a hands-on introduction covering connecting to and using the SCC for new users. This tutorial will cover a few basic Linux commands but we strongly encourage people to also take our more extensive “Introduction to Linux” tutorial.</p>

		  <p class="workshop-excerpt">How did digital humanities start? What have humanities and social sciences practitioners done in it so far? What are they doing these days? In what ways is it useful to modern-day researchers in these fields? What venues exist for scholarly communication in DH? We will speak specifically to fields represented in the room. We will then introduce some basic activities that make up digital scholarship, applicable to both students and faculty-level researchers in the humanities and social sciences. Participants will leave with a list of suggested resources to follow up on if they wish.</p>

It is oriented towards those who have little or no prior programming experience and would like to get a solid start. It will introduce Perl through an integrated approach, covering all of the fundamentals of the Perl language, from code design and implementation to debugging and execution. It will also include information on the Perl help system, to ease the learning curve and provide an entry point for continuous exploration of the language. The tutorial itself will focus mostly on methodology and concepts; however, it will make an effort to achieve this goal through several quite simple, yet representative, code examples. The entire tutorial will be divided into two sessions. The first session will give students a brief overview and general information about Perl, with some hands-on exercises. The second session will focus on some frequently used language features, such as file I/O, string processing, regular expressions, and even some more advanced features, such as code reuse. All of the features will be introduced through some real bioinformatical examples. Please remember to sign up for both sessions to complete the tutorial.</p>

		  <p class="workshop-excerpt">The OpenMP application program interface (API) provides simple and flexible tools to develop parallel software for shared-memory multiprocessor systems. The basic approach to parallelizing with OpenMP is to insert special comments (directives) into the code that assist the compiler in mapping computation onto the CPUs. The beauty of this approach is that it is often possible to create efficient parallel code with only minor modifications to a serial code. This tutorial covers the major features of OpenMP through discussion and examples in C and Fortran. Some experience in C or Fortran programming is assumed. Understanding of parallel programming in general is helpful, but not required.</p>

		  <p class="workshop-excerpt">MATLAB programs can be exceptionally fast if they are well-designed, and painfully slow if not. Fortunately, it does not take a professional programmer to write an efficient MATLAB program or to take advantage of multi-core processors and computer clusters. This tutorial will introduce (1) using MATLAB on the BU SCC, and (2) optimizing MATLAB codes. The first part will cover how to use the MATLAB platform remotely and how submitting batch jobs for MATLAB works. In the second part, some useful skills for removing unnecessary computation and optimizing memory usage will be introduced. The skills you learn should enable you to solve bigger problems faster using MATLAB.</p>

We will talk about GIS, and spatial data (concept, and format). We will explore different ways to collect spatial data and to convert spatial data into a GIS friendly version. A list of GIS online platforms and programs will be introduced which we can utilize in digital humanities and social science projects. We will look into some examples of GIS projects in digital humanities and explore the programs and platforms to create these projects.</p>

		  <p class="workshop-excerpt">Topic models hold power for answering questions about textual corpora at scale. All the same, getting started with topic modeling can be intimidating—and working with topic models without understanding the theory behind them can easily lead to misinterpretations. In this introductory session, we will discuss what topic models can do, how they work, their potential and limitations. We will share several examples of research projects and processes using topic models and work with participants to determine how they might frame their own research questions in ways that could be answered with topic modeling. The session will give participants a solid understanding of how topic modeling works, so that they can decide whether they want to go further with learning how to use topic models in their research.</p>
