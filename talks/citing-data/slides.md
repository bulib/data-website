# Why cite data? 

## Data is part of the research record

## Citing data helps others reuse data

## Increase openness and transparency 

# Principles of Data Citation 

## These are from [Force11](https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final)

## Importance 

Data is a scholarly output and should be treated as such.

## Credit and Attribution 

People should be given credit for their data.

## Evidence 

If a scholarly work depends on data, that data should be cited.

## Unique Identification 

Data identification should be unique and persistent (it should also be machine readable).

## Access 

Data citations should provide access to the data and the appropriate documentation (metadata) that will make the data usable. 

## Persistence 

Citations should be persistent. 

## Specificity and Verifiability

The data citation should allow for the verification of a specific claim. This includes having the appropriate documentation about origin and version of the data.  

## Interoperability and Flexibility

Data citations should be flexible enough for various communities but not so different that interoperability is compromised. 

# How to cite data 

## Just like other works! 

## Citations should include 

+ Author
+ Title
+ Year
+ Publisher / Repository 
+ Edition / Version
+ Access (aka URL or DOI)

## Follow your specific style guide for more detailed information. 

# How to make your data citable 

## Find a data repository 

+ Zenodo 
+ Figshare
+ OpenBU 
+ Visit the Registry of Research Data Repositories ([re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/)) to find more. 

## Submit your data

## Get an persistent identifier (DOI or Handle)

## And cite your data 

# Thank you : )
