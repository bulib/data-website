# Background 

## 2 tidbits 

+ 2011 - NSF began requiring a data management plan with all new research proposals

+ 2013 - [OSTP (Office of Science and Technology Policy) memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf) on increasing access to the results of federally funded research 

# NSF Guidance 

## Your NSF DMP (Data Management Plan)

+ No more than 2 pages
+ Labeled "Data Management Plan"

Your DMP "[will conform to NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results.](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/gpg_2.jsp#dmp)" See [AAG Chapter VI.D.4](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/aag_6.jsp#VID4)

## Things to include 

+ Types of data, samples, etc 
+ Standards used for data and metadata format and content
+ Policies for access and sharing
+ Provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, intellectual property, or other rights. 
+ Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivations 
+ Plans for archiving, preservation, and access to data

## A few more details 

+ General NSF guidance applies if no specific guidance is given
+ Collaborative proposals and proposals that include subawards should include only one combined DMP
+ A valid DMP may include only a statement that no detailed plan is needed, as long as the statement is accompanied by a clear justification
+ If your DMP cannot fit within the two page limit you can use part of the 15-page Project Description. However, the 15-page Project Description limit still applies. 

## And Finally 

The DMP will be reviewed as an integral part of the proposal, considered under Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts or both, as appropriate for the scientific community of relevance.
