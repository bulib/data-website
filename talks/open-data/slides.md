## 
This talk is a distillation of Mozilla's [Working Open Workshop](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/) session on Open data and their [Open Data Training](https://github.com/mozillascience/open-data-training). We are going to: 

+ Discuss why open your data
+ How to open your data 
+ Data Reuse Plan 



# Why Open Your Data 

## What do you mean "open data"?

Let's use this definition:

>Open data is data that is made freely and easily available to anyone to use, re-use and distribute. 

## What makes data open? 

From the Open Knowledge Project:

+ Access and Availability 
+ Reuse and redistribution 
+ Universal participation

## Why open your data

+ Accountability 
+ Increase discovery 
+ Encourage collaboration 
+ Solve other problems 
+ Encourage public engagement 
+ Help with data preservation 

# How to Open Your Data 

## 

To make your data open, we have to take something very familiar to you and make it understandable to a stranger, a total stranger. 

That means metadata!

## Example time 

+ Open spreadsheet
+ Open PDF 

## As Mozilla says 

> Metadata, a love note to the future 

## Creating a README 

Tell the story of your data 

+ Who
+ What 
+ Where 
+ When 
+ Why 
+ How 

## Example outline 

+ Title 
+ Description 
+ Source 
+ Contact 
+ Location 
+ Place of publication 
+ When data was collected 
+ When data was published 
+ Collection methods 

## File formats - really matter 

If your file format can't be used by others, your data is not usable. Imagine if someone "shared" their spreadsheet with you as a PDF. 

# Data Reuse Plan 

## Field trip! 

To the interwebs for Mozilla's [Data Reuse Plan](https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/handouts/data_reuse_plan_template.md).
